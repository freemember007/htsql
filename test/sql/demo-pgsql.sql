CREATE SCHEMA ad;
COMMENT ON SCHEMA ad IS $_$
Administrative Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the basic 4-table schema used by the tutorial and regression
tests.  It is designed to use limited data types (varchar, memo, and
integer) as well as simple primary and foreign key relationships.

There are two top-level tables, ``department`` and ``school`` having a
single-column primary key ``code`` and a unique ``name``.  In this
schema, we associate departments with exactly one school, although the
``code`` for the department must be unique across schools.  Non-academic
departments are modeled with a ``NULL`` for their ``school_code``.

Two second-tier tables, ``course`` and ``program`` have compound primary
keys, consisting of a parent table and a second column.  For ``course``
table, we have an integer key, ``no`` which is a 3-digit course
code, scoped by department.  Hence, ``mth.101`` is distinct from
``eng.101`` even though they have the same course number.  The
``degree`` column of ``program`` is an authority controlled field, with
values ``ms``, ``bs`` and ``cert``; it is optional permitting programs
which do not offer a degree.

CREATE SCHEMA id;
COMMENT ON SCHEMA id IS $_$
Instructor Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This schema introduces 3 tables, a top-level ``instructor`` table
enumerating members of the university teaching staff, and two other
tables: ``appointment`` and ``confidential``.   These tables provide an
example of two concepts, a "cross product" (via ``appointment``) and
"facet" (via ``confidential``).  A cross product is a relationship
between two tables, in this case, ``department`` and ``instructor``.  A
facet is a set of columns attached to another table, either to address
permission differentiation or optionality.  Facets are useful for
representing sets of mutually-mandatory fields.  In this example, the
``confidential`` represents a table that is optionally present, and
likely having different permission restrictions.

This schema also introduces two data types.  The social security number,
or ``SSN`` of each instructor is a character value of fixed width.  The
``fraction`` column of ``appointment`` table is a ``DECIMAL(3,2)``
representing a number such as ``0.50`` for a half-time appointment of an
instructor to a given department.

CREATE SCHEMA cd;
COMMENT ON SCHEMA cd IS $_$
Class Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The principal purpose of this schema is to provide a highly linked table
with many foreign key references.  The table here, ``class``, represents
a ``course`` offering during a particular ``semester`` delivered by a
given ``instructor``.  The ``semester`` table has a compound primary key
of ``year`` and ``period``.  The ``class`` table has a 5 column primary
key, 2 columns referencing a given course (by number), 2 columns
referencing a semester, and finally, a 3-digit ``section`` number.

Since the natural primary key is so large, a secondary candidate key
``class_seq`` is provided.  This mandatory and unique column is then
referenced by down-stream tables, such as student enrollment.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This schema provides a fact table for use in demonstrating aggregates in
multiple dimensions.  The ``enrollment``, while only directly
referencing ``class`` and ``student``, indirectly provides summary
statics options by semester, course, program, department and other
dimensions.  The ``enrollment`` table is also a cross-product table,
reflecting a "membership" of a student within a given class.  Cross
products are used in relational databases to model many-to-many
relationships, in this case, the relationship has a few attribute
columns: ``status`` and ``grade``.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This schema focuses on recursive and linked structures.  The
``prerequisite`` cross-product table represents a many-to-many
relationship from ``course`` onto itself.  The ``classification`` table
represents a one-to-many self relationship, forming a a hierarchy.  The
``course_classification`` table is simply another cross-product tables
representing membership, associating a ``course`` with a
``classification``.

The classification table models distributional requirements, where a
course may be tagged with a specific program requirement, such as
``"art-history"`` which also acts as a broader distributional
requirement, ``"humanities"``.

A ``program_requirement`` table models an optional The hierarchy is
interpreted to imply that a class tagged with the former also counts to
fulfill requirements of the latter.
