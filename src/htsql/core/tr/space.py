class Expression(Hashable, Clonable, Printable):
    """
    Represents an expression node.

    This is an abstract class; most of its subclasses belong to one of the
    two categories: *space* and *code* nodes (see :class:`Space` and
    :class:`Code`).

    A space graph is an intermediate phase of the HTSQL translator.  It is
    translated from the flow graph by the *encoding* process.  The space
    graph is used to *compile* the term tree and then *assemble* the frame
    structure.

    A space graph reflects the space structure of the HTSQL query: each
    expression node represents either a data space or an expression over
    a data space.

    Expression nodes support equality by value: that is, two expression
    nodes are equal if they are of the same type and all their (essential)
    attributes are equal.  Some attributes (e.g. `flow`) are not
    considered essential and do not participate in comparison.  By-value
    semantics is respected when expression nodes are used as dictionary
    keys.

    The constructor arguments:

    `flow` (:class:`htsql.core.tr.flow.Flow`)
        The flow node that gave rise to the expression; should be used
        only for presentation or error reporting.

    Other attributes:

    `syntax` (:class:`htsql.core.tr.syntax.Syntax`)
        The syntax node that gave rise to the expression; for debugging
        purposes only.

    `mark` (:class:`htsql.core.mark.Mark`)
        The location of the node in the original query; for error reporting.

    `hash` (an integer)
        The node hash; if two nodes are considered equal, their hashes
        must be equal too.

class Space(Expression):
    """
    Represents a space node.

    A data space is a sequence of homogeneous values.  A space is generated
    by a series of space operations applied sequentially to the root space.

    Each space operation takes an input space as an argument and produces
    an output space as a result.  The operation transforms each element
    from the input row into zero, one, or more elements of the output
    space; the generating element is called *the origin* of the generated
    elements.  Thus, with every element of a space, we could associate
    a sequence of origin elements, one per each elementary space operation
    that together produce the space.

    Each instance of :class:`Space` represents a single space operation
    applied to some input space.  The `base` attribute of the instance
    represents the input space while the type of the instance and the
    other attributes reflect the properies of the operation.  The root
    space is denoted by an instance of:class:`RootSpace`, different
    subclasses of :class:`Space` correspond to different types of
    space operations.

    The type of values produced by a space is indicated by the `family`
    attribute.  We distinguish three space families: *scalar*, *table*
    and *quotient*.  A scalar space produces values of an elementary data
    type; a table space produces records of some table; a quotient space
    produces elements of a derived quotient class.

    Among others, we consider the following space operations:

    *The root space* `I`
        The initial space that contains one empty record.

    *A direct product* `A * T`
        Given a scalar space `A` and a table `T`, the direct product
        `A * T` generates all records of `T` for each element of `A`.

    *A fiber product* `A . T`
        Given an input space `A` that produces records of some table `S`
        and a table `T` linked to `S`, for each element of `A`,
        the fiber product `A . T` generates all associated records
        from `T`.

    *Filtering* `A ? p`
        Given a space `A` and a predicate `p` defined on `A`,
        the filtered space `A ? p` consists of all elements of `A`
        satisfying condition `p`.

    *Ordering* `A [e,...]`
        Given a space `A` and a list of expressions `e,...`, the
        ordered space `A [e,...]` consists of elements of `A` reordered
        by the values of `e,...`.

    *Quotient* `A ^ k`
        Given a space `A` and a kernel expression `k` defined on `A`,
        a quotient `A ^ k` produces all unique values of the kernel
        as it runs over `A`.

    Space operations for which the output space does not consist of
    elements of the input space are called *axial*.  If we take an
    arbitrary space `A`, disassemble it into individual operations,
    and then reapply only axial operations, we get the new space `A'`,
    which we call *the inflation* of `A`.  Note that elements of `A`
    form a subset of elements of `A'`.

    Now we can establish how different spaces are related to each other.
    Formally, for each pair of spaces `A` and `B`, we define a relation
    `<->` ("converges to") on elements from `A` and `B`, that is,
    a subset of the Cartesian product `A x B`, by the following rules:

    (1) For any space `A`, `<->` is the identity relation on `A`,
        that is, each element converges only to itself.

        For a space `A` and its inflation `A'`, each element from `A`
        converges to an equal element from `A'`.

    (2) Suppose `A` and `B` are spaces such that `A` is produced
        from `B` as a result of some axial space operation.  Then
        each element from `A` converges to its origin element
        from `B`.

        By transitivity, we could extend `<->` on `A` and any of its
        *ancestor spaces*, that is, the parent space of `A`, the
        parent of the parent of `A` and so on.

        In particular, this defines `<->` on an arbitrary space `A`
        and the root space `I` since `I` is an ancestor of any space.
        By the above definition, any element of `A` converges to
        the (only) record of `I`.

    (3) Finally, we are ready to define `<->` on an arbitrary pair
        of spaces `A` and `B`.  First, suppose that `A` and `B`
        share the same inflated space: `A' = B'`.  Then we could
        define `<->` on `A` and `B` transitively via `A'`: `a` from `A`
        converges to `b` from `B` if there exists `a'` from `A'` such
        that `a <-> a'` and `a' <-> b`.

        In the general case, find the closest ancestors `C` of `A`
        and `D` of `B` such that `C` and `D` have the same
        inflated space: `C' = D'`.  Rules `(1)` and `(2)` establish
        `<->` for the pairs `A` and `C`, `C` and `C' = D'`,
        `C' = D'` and `D`, and `D` and `B`.  We define `<->`
        on `A` and `B` transitively: `a` from `A` converges to
        `b` from `B` if there exist elements `c` from `C`,
        `c'` from `C' = D'`, `d` from `D` such that
        `a <-> c <-> c' <-> d <-> b`.

        Note that it is important that we take among the common inflated
        ancestors the closest one.  Any two spaces have a common inflated
        ancestor: the root space.  If the root space is, indeed, the closest
        common inflated ancestor of `A` and `B`, then each element of `A`
        converges to every element of `B`.

    Now we are ready to introduce several important relations between
    spaces:

    `A` *spans* `B`
        A space `A` spans a space `B` if for every element `a` from `A`:

            `card { b` from `B | a <-> b } <= 1`.

        Informally, it means that the statement::

            SELECT * FROM A

        and the statement::

            SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON (A <-> B)

        produce the same number of rows.

    `A` *dominates* `B`
        A space `A` dominates a space `B` if `A` spans `B` and
        for every element `b` from `B`:

            `card { a` from `A | a <-> b } >= 1`.

        Informally, it implies that the statement::

            SELECT * FROM B INNER JOIN A ON (A <-> B)

        and the statement::

            SELECT * FROM B LEFT OUTER JOIN A ON (A <-> B)

        produce the same number of rows.

    `A` *conforms* `B`
        A space `A` conforms a space `B` if `A` dominates `B`
        and `B` dominates `A`.  Alternatively, we could say
        `A` conforms `B` if the `<->` relation establishes
        a bijection between `A` and `B`.

        Informally, it means that the statement::

            SELECT * FROM A

        and the statement::

            SELECT * FROM B

        produce the same number of rows.

        Note that `A` conforming `B` is not the same as `A` being equal
        to `B`; even if `A` conforms `B`,  elements of `A` and `B` may
        be of different types, therefore as sets, they are different.

    Now take an arbitrary space `A` and its parent space `B`.  We say:

    `A` *contracts* `B`
        A space `A` contracts its parent `B` if for any element from `B`
        there is no more than one converging element from `A`.

        Typically, it is non-axis spaces that contract their bases,
        although in some cases, an axis space could do it too.

    `A` *expands* `B`
        A space `A` expands its parent `B` if for any element from `B`
        there is at least one converging element from `A`.

        Note that it is possible that a space `A` both contracts and
        expands its base `B`, and also that `A` neither contracts
        nor expands `B`.  The former means that `A` conforms `B`.
        The latter holds, in particular, for the direct table space
        `A * T`.  `A * T` violates the contraction condition when
        `T` contains more than one record and violates the expansion
        condition when `T` has no records.

    A few words about how elements of a space are ordered.  The default
    (also called *weak*) ordering rules are:

    - a table space `T = I * T` is sorted by the lexicographic order
      of the table primary key;

    - a non-axial space keeps the order of its base;

    - an axial table space `A * T` or `A . T` respects the order its
      base `A`; records with the same origin are sorted by the table order.

    An alternative sort order could be specified explicitly (also called
    *strong* ordering).  Whenever strong ordering is  specified, it
    overrides the weak ordering.  Thus, elements of an ordered space `A [e]`
    are sorted first by expression `e`, and then elements which are not
    differentiated by `e` are sorted using the weak ordering of `A`.
    However, if `A` already has a strong ordering, it must be respected.
    Therefore, the general rule for sorting `A [e]` is:

    - first, sort the space by the strong ordering of `A`;

    - then, by `e`;

    - finally, by the weak ordering of `A`.

    Class attributes:

    `is_axis` (Boolean)
        Indicates whether the space is axial, that is, the elements
        of the space do not necessarily coincide with their origins.

    Represents a unit expression.

    A unit is an elementary function on a space.  There are several kinds
    of units; see subclasses :class:`ColumnUnit`, :class:`ScalarUnit`,
    :class:`AggregateUnit`, and :class:`CorrelatedUnit` for more detail.

    Units are divided into two categories: *primitive* and *compound*.

    A primitive unit is an intrinsic function of its space; no additional
    calculations are required to generate a primitive unit.  Currently,
    the only example of a primitive unit is :class:`ColumnUnit`.

    A compound unit requires calculating some non-intrinsic function
    on the target space.  Among compound units there are :class:`ScalarUnit`
    and :class:`AggregateUnit`, which correspond respectively to
    scalar and aggregate functions on a space.

    Note that it is easy to *lift* a unit code from one space to another.
    Specifically, suppose a unit `u` is defined on a space `A` and `B`
    is another space such that `B` spans `A`.  Then for each row `b`
    from `B` there is no more than one row `a` from `A` such that `a <-> b`.
    Therefore we could define `u` on `B` as follows:

    - `u(b) = u(a)` if there exists `a` from `A` such that `a <-> b`;
    - `u(b) =` ``NULL`` if there is no rows in `A` convergent to `b`.

    When a space `B` spans the space `A` of a unit `u`, we say that
    `u` is *singular* on `B`.  By the previous argument, `u` could be
    lifted to `B`.  Thus any unit is well-defined not only on the
    space where it is originally defined, but also on any space where
    it is singular.

    Attributes:

    `space` (:class:`Space`)
        The space on which the unit is defined.

    `domain` (:class:`htsql.core.domain.Domain`)
        The unit co-domain.

    Class attributes:

    `is_primitive` (Boolean)

        `F(u(a),v(b),...)`,

    where

    - `F` is a scalar function;
    - `a`, `b`, ... are elements of spaces `A`, `B`, ...;
    - `u`, `v`, ... are unit expressions on `A`, `B`, ....

    We require that the units of the expression are singular on the given
    space.  If so, the expression units `u`, `v`, ... could be lifted to
    the given slace (see :class:`Unit`).  The scalar unit is defined as

        `F(u(x),v(x),...)`,

    where `x` is an element of the space where the scalar unit is defined.

    `code` (:class:`Code`)
        The expression to evaluate.

    `space` (:class:`Space`)
        The space on which the unit is defined.

    `companions` (list of :class:`Code`)
        An auxiliary hint to the compiler indicating that the term
        exporting the unit must also export extra scalar units.
        The value of this attribute has no effect on the semantics of
        the space graph and node comparison.

    Aggregate units express functions on sets.  Specifically, let `A` and `B`
    be spaces such that `B` spans `A`, but  `A` does not span `B`, and

    rows from `B` and apply `g` to it; the result is the value of `u(a)`.
