HTSQL was created in 2005 to provide an *XPath*-like HTTP interface to
*PostgreSQL* for client-side *XSLT* screens and reports.  HTSQL found
its audience when analysts and researchers bypassed the user interface
and started to use URLs directly.  The language has evolved since then.

What is HTSQL?
==============

HTSQL is a comprehensive navigational query language for relational
databases and web service gateway.

HTSQL is a Web Service
----------------------

.. container:: vsplit

   .. sourcecode:: text

      http://demo.htsql.org/school

   .. image:: img/show_school.png
      :alt: output of /school query
      :target: http://demo.htsql.org/school

*On the left is a URL, on the right is what a browser would show.*

HTSQL is a query language for the web.  Queries are URLs that can be
directly typed into a browser; the output could be returned in a variety
of formats including HTML, CSV, JSON, etc.  HTSQL can be used as the basis
for dashboarding tools and other browser-based applications.  In this way,
database queries can be shared, tweaked, and used in any number of ways.

HTSQL is a Relational Database Gateway
--------------------------------------

.. container:: vsplit

   .. htsql:: /school
      :no-output:

   .. sourcecode:: sql

      SELECT "school"."code",
             "school"."name",
             "school"."campus"
      FROM "ad"."school"
      ORDER BY 1 ASC

*On the left is an HTSQL query, on the right is SQL it is translated to.*

HTSQL wraps your existing existing relational database, transparently
handling SQL complexities for you.  The current version of HTSQL supports
*SQLite*, *PostgreSQL*, *MySQL*, *Oracle*, and *Microsoft SQL Server*.
We've taken care to abstract differences between these SQL dialects
so that a given HTSQL query has consistent semantics across database
server implementations.

HTSQL is an Advanced Query Language
-----------------------------------

.. container:: vsplit

   .. htsql::
      :no-output:

      /school{name,
              count(program),
              count(department)}

   .. sourcecode:: sql

      SELECT "school"."name", COALESCE("program"."count", 0), COALESCE("department"."count", 0)
      FROM "ad"."school"
      LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT COUNT(TRUE) AS "count", "program"."school_code" FROM "ad"."program" GROUP BY 2) AS "program" ON ("school"."code" = "program"."school_code")
      LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT COUNT(TRUE) AS "count", "department"."school_code" FROM "ad"."department" GROUP BY 2) AS "department" ON ("school"."code" = "department"."school_code")
      ORDER BY "school"."code" ASC

*On the left is an HTSQL query, on the right is SQL it is translated to.*

Besides typical expression algebra and function set, HTSQL provides
sophisicated navigational query mechanism, composable query fragments
and an extensive macro inclusion system.  In particular, nested
aggregations and projections are easy to understand and use.

HTSQL is a Communication Tool
-----------------------------

.. container:: vsplit

   .. sourcecode:: html

      Show me schools, and, for each school,
      - its name, its location,
      - number of programs and departments,
      - and the average number of courses
        across each of its departments?

   .. htsql::
      :no-output:

      /school{name, campus,
              count(program),
              count(department),
              avg(department.
                  count(course))}

*On the left is a business inquiry, on the right is the HTSQL translation.*

HTSQL is first and formost designed for the *accidental programmer* and
as such provides a direct mapping of common business inquiries onto a
computer parsable and executable syntax.  Just because a query must be
processable by a machine, doesn't mean it shouldn't be human readable.


HTSQL is a Python Library
-------------------------

.. container:: vsplit

   .. sourcecode:: python

      from htsql import HTSQL
      demo = HTSQL("pgsql:///htsql_demo")
      rows = demo.produce("/school")
      for row in rows:
          print row

   .. sourcecode:: python

      school(code=u'art',
             name=u'School of Art & Design',
             campus=u'old')
      school(code=u'bus',
             name=u'School of Business',
             campus=u'south')
      ...

HTSQL can be embedded into any Python application to provide an
intuitive object based query engine for complex reporting.  It
works out of the box with Jinja and other tools.  We provide
meta-data adapters for Django and SQLAlchemy.


Our Philosophy
==============

We develop HTSQL to liberate the *Accidental Programmer* |mdash|
professionals and data experts who are not software engineers by trade,
but who must write database queries or data processing code to get
things done.  HTSQL handles routine data processing needs in an
accessible, transparent, rigorous and embeddable manner.

Accessible
----------

We want HTSQL to be broadly usable.  Our query language should provide
business analysts, information scientists, and data curators
self-service access and control over their database.  Not only should
these *accidental programmers* be able able to answer complex business
inquiries themselves, they should be able to share the queries they
create with their colleagues.  HTSQL must be a productive tool for
problem solving with a small learning curve.

Transparent
-----------

We think aesthetics matter.  When a data analyst is focusing on a domain
specific problem, the HTSQL query language should do the heavy lifting
but otherwise stay in the background.  Translation of a business inquiry
into the HTSQL query language must be natural and obvious.  Initial query
authoring is just the beginning.  A database query is often the only human
readable expression of a business rule, so each and every query must be a
pleasure to review, share and maintain.

Rigorous
--------

We know correctness is critical.  The HTSQL query language is based upon
a navigational data linking and flow processing model having consistent
semantics that are independent of the underlying database architecture.
The language designed to be composable so that query fragments can be
independently tested and combined.  HTSQL's syntax is regular enough
that syntax highlighting and context sensitive name lookup is possible.

Embeddable
----------

We realize a query language is not a product.  Instead, HTSQL is a tool
used as part of a workflow solution or embedded into an application.
Our public application program interface is be simple and stable.
Further, since *accidental programmers* might require features which
other software developers could build, we have an extensive plug-in
interface for those who wish to add features to HTSQL itself.  Between
web service wrappers or plug-ins, it should be possible to customize
almost every aspect of HTSQL without requiring a code fork.


HTSQL in a Nutshell
===================

HTSQL was designed from the ground up as a self-serve reporting tool
for data analysts.  With HTSQL, the easy stuff is truly easy; and,
the complex stuff is easy too.

In this section we introduce the fundamentals of HTSQL syntax and
semantics.  For a more incremental approach, please read the
:doc:`tutorial`.  For the purposes of this section, we use a
fictitious university schema.

.. texfigure:: dia/administrative-directory-small-schema.tex
   :align: center

This data model has two top-level tables, ``school`` and ``department``,
where ``department`` has an optional link to ``school``.  Subordinate
tables, ``course`` and ``program``, have mandatory links to their parents.


Scalar Expressions
------------------

Literal values:

.. htsql:: /{3.14159, 'Hello World!'}

Algebraic expressions:

.. htsql:: /(3+4)*6

Predicate expressions:

.. htsql:: /(7<13)&(1=0|1!=0)

Navigation
----------

A table name by itself produces all records from that table:

.. htsql:: /school
   :cut: 4

In the scope of ``school`` table, ``department`` is a link to
associated records from ``department`` table.  The following query
returns ``department`` records via navigation though ``school``:

.. htsql:: /school.department
   :cut: 4

This query works as follows:

* ``school`` generates all records from ``school`` table;
* for each ``school`` record, ``department`` generates
  associated ``department`` records;

Filtering
---------

Sieve operator produces records satisfying the specified condition:

.. htsql:: /school?campus='south'

Sorting operator reorders records:

.. htsql:: /school.sort(campus)
   :cut: 4

Truncating operator takes a slice from the record sequence:

.. htsql:: /school.limit(2)

Selection & Definition
----------------------

Selection specifies output columns:

.. htsql:: /school{name, campus}
   :cut: 4

Title decorator defines the title of an output column:

.. htsql:: /school{name, count(department) :as '# of Dept'}
   :cut: 4

Output records could nest:

.. htsql:: /department{name, school{name, campus}}
   :cut: 4

Calculated attributes factor out repeating expressions:

.. htsql::

   /school.define(num_dept := count(department))
          {code, num_dept}?num_dept>3

References carry over values across nested scopes:

.. htsql::
   :cut: 4

   /define($avg_credits := avg(course.credits))
    .course{title, credits}?credits>$avg_credits

Locators
--------

Locator operator picks a single record by ID:

.. htsql:: /department[comp]

A composite ID consists of labels separated by a period:

.. htsql:: /course[comp.515]

Function ``id()`` returns the record ID:

.. htsql:: /department[comp].course.id()
   :cut: 3

Nested Segments
---------------

The segment (``/``) operator embeds a result of a correlated query as a
nested list.  For instance, a list of schools could include associated
departments:

.. htsql:: /school{*, /department}
   :cut: 7
.. **

Nesting can be arbitrarily deep:

.. htsql::
   :cut: 35

   /school{name+,
           /department{name,
                       /course{title}}}

A query may have adjacent nested segments:

.. htsql:: /school{name, /department{name}, /program{title}}
   :cut: 12

Aggregation
-----------

Aggregates convert plural expressions to singular values.

Scalar aggregates:

.. htsql:: /count(department)

Nested aggregates:

.. htsql:: /avg(school.count(department))

Various aggregation operations:

.. htsql::
   :cut: 4

   /department{name, count(course),
                     max(course.credits),
                     sum(course.credits),
                     avg(course.credits)}?exists(course)

Projection
----------

Projection (``^``) returns distinct values.  This example
returns distinct ``campus`` values from the ``school`` table:

.. htsql:: /school^campus

In the scope of the projection, ``school`` refers to all records from
``school`` table having the same value of ``campus`` attribute:

.. htsql:: /school^campus {campus, count(school), /school}
   :cut: 5

Projections combine with other language features in a natural way.  The
next example displays distinct program degrees offered by each school:

.. htsql:: /school{name, count(program^degree), /program^degree}
   :cut: 6

Linking
-------

Links between tables are automatic and relative, inferred from foreign
key constraints.  Unlink (``@``) permits arbitrary, non-relative linking.

.. htsql::
   :cut: 4

   /school{name, count(department)}
          ?count(department)>avg(@school.count(department))

The query above returns schools with the number of departments above
average among all schools.

Output
------

HTSQL can output the result in a variery of formats.  JSON:

.. htsql:: /school{code, name}/:json
   :cut: 10

XML:

.. htsql:: /school{code, name}/:xml
   :cut: 10

CSV:

.. htsql:: /school{code, name}/:csv
   :cut: 3


Why not SQL?
============

Relational algebra is frequently inadequate for encoding business
inquiries --- elementary set operations do not correspond to
meaningful data transformations.  The SQL language itself is tedious,
verbose, and provides poor means of abstraction.  Yet, the relational
database is an excellent tool for data modeling, storage and retrieval.

HTSQL reimagines what it means to query a database.  The combination of
a *navigational model* with *data flows* enables expressions that
naturally reflect business inquiries.  The HTSQL translator uses SQL as
a target assembly language, which allows us to fix the query model and
language while keeping current investment in relational systems.


SQL Conflates Rows & Columns
----------------------------

    *"For each department, please show the department name and the
    corresponding school's campus."*

This business inquiry clearly separates the requested rows (*each
department*) and columns (*department name* and *corresponding school's
campus*), but this separation is lost when the query is encoded in SQL:

.. sourcecode:: sql

    SELECT d.name, s.campus
    FROM ad.department AS d
    LEFT JOIN ad.school AS s
           ON (d.school_code = s.code);

In this SQL query, the ``FROM`` clause not only picks target rows, but
also includes extra tables required to produce output columns.  This
conflation makes it difficult to determine business entities represented
by each row of the output.

.. htsql::
   :cut: 4
   :no-output:

    /department{name, school.campus}

The HTSQL translation separates the row definition from the column
selection.  The linking is implicit, and correct.  The encoded query can
be read aloud as a verbal inquiry.

SQL Conflates Filters & Links
-----------------------------

    *"For each department, return the department's name and number of
    courses having more than 2 credit hours."*

This business inquiry returns *department* records, and for each record
summarizes associated courses meeting a particular criteria.

.. sourcecode:: sql

    SELECT d.name, COUNT(SELECT TRUE FROM ad.course AS c
                         WHERE c.department_code = d.code
                           AND c.credits > 2)
    FROM ad.department AS d;

For this SQL encoding, the ``WHERE`` clause of the subquery conflates
the linking of ``course`` to ``department`` with the filter criteria.

.. sourcecode:: sql

    SELECT d.name, COUNT(c)
    FROM ad.department AS d
    LEFT JOIN ad.course AS c
           ON (c.department_code = d.code
               AND c.credits > 2)
    GROUP BY d.name;

In a common optimization, the correlated subquery is replaced with a
``GROUP BY`` projection.  This encoding further obfuscates the business
inquiry by conflating in two ways --- row/column and link/filter.

.. htsql::
   :cut: 4
   :no-output:

    /department{name, count(course?credits>2)}

The HTSQL translation keeps the filter criteria separate from linking
and the row definition separate from output columns.  The query adheres
the form of the original business inquiry.

Conflating Projection with Aggregation
--------------------------------------

    *"How many departments by campus?"*

This business inquiry asks for rows corresponding to each campus, and
for each row, the number of correlated departments.  In the schema,
there isn't a ``campus`` table, so we have to take *distinct* values of
``campus`` column from the ``school`` table.  This operation is called
*projection*.

.. sourcecode:: sql

    SELECT s.campus, COUNT(d)
    FROM ad.school AS s
    LEFT JOIN ad.department AS d
      ON (s.code = d.school_code)
    WHERE s.campus IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY s.campus;

For this SQL encoding, the ``GROUP BY`` clause combines two operations:
projection and evaluating the aggregate ``COUNT()``.  This conflation
causes a reader of the query some effort determining what sort of rows
are returned and how the aggregate is related to those rows.

.. htsql::
   :cut: 4
   :no-output:

    /school^campus {campus, count(school.department)}

In the HTSQL query, we start with an explicit projection (the ``^``
operator), then we select correlated columns.  This way, the aggregation
is indicated separately as part of the column selector rather than being
conflated with the row definition.

SQL Lacks Means of Encapsulation
--------------------------------

    *"For each department, return the department name and the number of
    offered 100's, 200's, 300's and 400's courses."*

In this business inquiry, we are asked to evaluate the same statistic
across multiple ranges.

.. sourcecode:: sql

    SELECT d.name,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN c.no BETWEEN 100 AND 199 THEN TRUE END),
           COUNT(CASE WHEN c.no BETWEEN 200 AND 299 THEN TRUE END),
           COUNT(CASE WHEN c.no BETWEEN 300 AND 399 THEN TRUE END),
           COUNT(CASE WHEN c.no BETWEEN 400 AND 499 THEN TRUE END)
    FROM ad.department AS d
    LEFT JOIN ad.course AS c
           ON (c.department_code = d.code)
    GROUP BY d.name;

This query is tedious to write and error prone to maintain since SQL
provides no way to factor the repetitive expression ``COUNT(...)``.

.. htsql::
   :cut: 4
   :no-output:

    /department.define(
         count_courses($level) := count(course?no>=$level*100
                                              &no<($level+1)*100))
      {name, count_courses(1),
             count_courses(2),
             count_courses(3),
             count_courses(4)}

The HTSQL translation avoids this duplication by defining a calculated
attribute ``count_courses($level)`` on the ``department`` table and
then evaluating it for each course level.

In SQL, Modest Complexity is Painful
------------------------------------

    *"For each school with a degree program, return the school's name,
    and the average number of high-credit (>3) courses its departments
    have."*

This business inquiry asks us to do the following:

* pick records from the ``school`` table

* keep only those with an associated degree program

* for each school record, compute average of:

  - for each associated department, count:

    - associated courses with credits>3

.. sourcecode:: sql

    SELECT s.name, o.avg_over_3
    FROM ad.school AS s
    JOIN ad.program AS p ON (p.school_code = s.code)
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT d.school_code, AVG(COALESCE(i.over_3,0)) AS avg_over_3
        FROM ad.department d
        LEFT JOIN (
            SELECT c.department_code, COUNT(c) AS over_3
            FROM ad.course AS c WHERE c.credits > 3
            GROUP BY c.department_code
        ) AS i ON (i.department_code = d.code)
        GROUP BY d.school_code
    ) AS o ON (o.school_code = s.code)
    GROUP BY s.name, o.avg_over_3;


Not only is this SQL encoding is hard to read, it took several passes to
get right --- without the ``COALESCE`` you get results that look
correct, but aren't.

.. htsql::
   :cut: 4
   :no-output:

     /school?exists(program)
       {name, avg(department.count(course?credits>3))}

Each syntactic component of the HTSQL query is self-contained; when
assembled, they form a cohesive translation of the business inquiry.
